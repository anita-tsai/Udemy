// how to deploy our backend code and database code
// -> use 'Hiroku' to have another server

// 1) a server is a computer
// And we put our node files on this computer
// We run the node file 
// and the server is going to be running the entire time, 
// just waiting, waiting to hear from the outside world 
// until somebody pings us, makes an HTTP request 
// and we do something with it.
// -> So we're going to deploy our note code to Heroku.


// 2) Hiroku
// And Hiroku is going to give us 
// for free a computer somewhere in the world 
// that we can put our node.js files to our backend code.
// And it's going to wait for us to be able to ping it whenever we want.
// Now we could leave our front, 
// encode our Smart Brain app on GitHub pages.

// 3) show you how to create a server
// not just in your own computer
