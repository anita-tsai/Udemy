The goal of this challenge is to practice our logic skills. 
Something that is useful not only in interviews 
when you get challenging problems, 
but also in your day to day work as a developer. 

First, start off by reading this article:

Now, head on over to get the challenge here.

If you had fun and would like to keep going, 
the challenges will get harder and harder, 
but you are only required to complete this first one :)

See you in the next video, and good luck!

P.S. As a community, 
we do Advent of Code challenges every day in December. 
Join in! If you're seeing this and it's not December,
