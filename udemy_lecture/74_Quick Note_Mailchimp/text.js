// Quick Note: Mailchimp
/*

In the next video, 
we will be using a popular mailing service called Mailchimp. 
As most Software as a Service companies do, 
they change their website design all the time, which means that
what you might see in the next video 
might not be how their website is organized today. 
For this reason, 
I have attached the below link which will be kept up to date by Mailchimp 
that shows you how to create the subscribe form. 
Please use it if you get lost in the next lecture :)
