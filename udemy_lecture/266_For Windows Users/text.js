/*
For Windows Users
Wolfgang, one of our fellow students
 ( and master of answering questions in this community) 
 created a set of videos for Windows users 
 that you can watch in order to make sure everything 
 that I do on my Mac, also works on Windows.
  Scroll down to the very last section of the course titled: 
  For Windows Users, and check out the Introduction video 
  and the Installing Node.js for Windows video!
