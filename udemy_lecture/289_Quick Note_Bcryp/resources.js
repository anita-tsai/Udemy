/*
Just letting you know that in the next video 
we're going to talk about this package called B crypt node js.

Now if you go to this page now in NPM 
you'll get a little warning here saying that 
this package has been deprecated 
and that they recommend you use something else.

You either use B crypt or b crypt.js

Now both of these are implementations of something 
we're going to talk about which is B crypt 
and I'll link to this resource 
so you can actually find out about the difference one is in JavaScript.

The other one is in C++.
Another programming language however for this project 
because this is our own personal project we're going to use B crypt node JS still.

And the reason I do this is because B crypt no Jesus was specifically created.

So it works both on Mac and Linux as well as windows 
because with the other packages based on whatever
your operating system is you might encounter some errors.

So if you want you can use those packages especially 
when you have a real life app that stores user passwords.

But in our case I want us to use B script.

Node J.S. because although it's no longer maintained 
that is it doesn't get any updates.
It will guarantee that it works on all systems for this lesson.

So I still recommend using B crypt node JS 
if you want later on you can upgrade 
or change the package to be crypt B crypt yes.

Most of the time these will work.

But I want to avoid anybody having issues 
so that we can get this project ready and deployed.
