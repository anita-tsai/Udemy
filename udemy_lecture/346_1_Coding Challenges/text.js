Coding Challenges

We run monthly coding challenges as part of this course. 
Each month the challenge is selected to improve a specific part 
of what it takes to be a great developer. 
These challenges will sometimes come with awesome prizes as well! 
If you are looking for extra practice, project ideas, 
or want to keep your skills up to date, 
I recommend you keep an eye out on the announcement email from Udemy, 
or follow the #coding-challenge channel on Discord. 

I also recommend you try some of the past challenges 
while comparing your code to other students from this course. 
You can find all of the challenges that have happened in the past, 
including the current one you can join here.
