// 1) DBMS

/*
It's called database management system or DBMS for short.

It's a collection of programs which allows us 
to access databases and work with data.

And it also allows controlled access to database users.

So a DBMS is something in this box 
something that allows us a tool or a piece of software that allows
us to communicate with the database, store information 
that's useful for us and also allows us to update,
insert, delete, look up whatever's in the database.

// 2) Postgres & MongoDB
/*
And these two types are represented really well by Postgres and MongoDB.

So once you know one it's fairly easy to pick up the other ones
- how do they actually communicate with the server with the Backend. 
Well all relational databases use something called SQL.

And SQL allows us to communicate just like HTTP did 
between the frontend and the backend. 
With SQL we're able to communicate with the database 
and modify or get or update however we want.
