// Resource: Clarifai API Docs
// Whenever you work with a 3rd party API, 
// you always have to be aware that their documentation page sometimes changes. 
// Part of your job as a developer is to stay on top of these changes 
// and adapt to any updates that they may have. 
// This is why the more dependencies you have in your projects, 
// the more likely it is for your project to break or need updating.
//  For now, I have added the API docs and information 
//  that you will need the rest of this project so you can always use them 
//  as a reference:

// Face Detection model we will 
// be using: https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection

// How we will use the API with JS 
// (don't worry I will show you the easy way to do this):
// https://github.com/Clarifai/clarifai-javascript#basic-use


// Finally, this is the list of all the models you can use 
// with this API if you want to customize your project:
