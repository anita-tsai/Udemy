// My Advice On Getting Hired

/*
If you never ask, the answer is always no.

You should value yourself. 
Most importantly, you should value the fact 
that you are giving your most precious resource (time) to an employer. 
Make the right choice when selecting employers. 
It is as much about what you want as it is about what they want. 
Work for a company that respects your time. 
Otherwise why would you want to be there?
