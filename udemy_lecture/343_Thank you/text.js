// Thank you

/*

Truly, thank you for completing the course. 
I hope you are able to do what you want with this knowledge now. 
I would love to hear from you about your experiences 
and where this course has gotten you in your life.  
You can also follow me on twitter where I will announce when my next course is out 
(I am currently working on it!): @andreineagoie

It will really mean a lot to me if you are able to leave a positive review 
if you have enjoyed this course. 
Reviews mean everything on a website like udemy, 
and it is the only way I can be discovered by others. 

Please keep in touch and share this course to anybody 
that may benefit from it. 
Until next time. Buh bye. 

OH BY THE WAY, I have now released a part 2 of this course 
that takes you on your next steps into more advanced topics:
