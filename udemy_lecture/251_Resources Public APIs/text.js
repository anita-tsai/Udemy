// Resources: Public APIs
// Once you learn about APIs as you have just done, 
// you realize that there is a world of possibilities of what you can build. 
// Your own startup? Your own app? The possibilities are endless. 
// Here is my favourite resource listing some of the public APIs 
// you can use to build anything you want. Enjoy exploring it!

// Finally, an important skill to develop is the ability 
// to read documentation of an API and learn how to use it. 
// Try playing this game, read the documentation, 
// and use the developer tools to "debug". 
// It will be good practice and a lot of fun!
