Project Files: Github


You can find the project files for the final SmartBrain project below. 
Please note that these files include all the changes made up 
to the end of the section we implement the backend 
plus the database and connect it to the frontend. 
(so the code will match once you finish 
the FINAL PROJECT: SmartBrain Back-End -- Database Section) 
You will also need to add your own Clarifai API key in App.js (which is free). 
Keep watching and you will get there too :)
