/* Quick Note: req.header */

/*
Just a heads up that in the next lecture 
I am using req.header inside of a console.log 
to retrieve the header data in a GET route. 
Depending on which version of express.js you use, 
(a more recent version has changed the syntax) 
it now is req.headers
req.header will only return the function declaration.
