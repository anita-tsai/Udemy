ES6 Modules??
If you have watched the lecture in the section titled 
Latest Version of Node.js you will notice ES6 imports
might work for you! Congratulations! That means 
you have Node version 12.2.0 or higher! As time will pass,
you will encounter less and less use of CommonJS modules 
and more Node projects using native ES6 modules. 
However, I have kept the CommonJS way of importing and exporting 
since it will be good practice for us 
when we encounter older codebases (and because we have already learned 
about ES6 style imports/exports previously)
