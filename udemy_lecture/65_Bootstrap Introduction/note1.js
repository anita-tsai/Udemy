Bootstrap is one of the most popular projects ever for developers.

And what it is, is just a css file and JavaScript file.

But why would that be one of the most popular projects?
Well, one thing you might have noticed 
is that writing css from scratch is a bit of a pain.

Wouldn't it be nice if you can use something 
that has already been created by somebody so that not every
single developer has to keep reinventing the wheel 
and keep writing everything from scratch?

And that is the idea behind bootstrap.
Bootstrap was created to solve this problem 
so that we can create websites really, really fast by using
somebody else's css and building on top of it.
