// 1)website: https://github.com/aneagoie/face-recognition-brain
// clone the package on your local station

// 2)create an API key:
// click my-first-application
// click 'CREATE NEWã€€API KEY'
// copy the new API key and paste on your code

// 3)TO check the API is still go to a link?

// reason : when we use an API, sometimes a server goes down or 
// an API does not work, especially since we are using the free version.

// how : you canactually see that the face detection model here is working for them.
// If it is not working well, then this blue box wouldn't appear on this website.
// So this is a good way to try and make sure that their model works.

// 4)go to API guide
// : Making Predictions -> Images

// 5) you can change any models you have -> eg: GENERAL_MODEL
// console : If we now go to Output's Zero and data, 
// this is the data that the general model returns for us.
// find : So by just changing the model, 
// I was able to learn new information about the picture.
