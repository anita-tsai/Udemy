  We want to check whatever the user enters on the front-end

  So it sounds like we need some sort of a database

// Jhon has submitted photos for face detection

// to make sure that we use 'POST',
// so we have to access to 'req.body()'
// -> we need a conditional statement

// click post-> body-> raw-> JSON
// enter what we want to send with our body
  // {
  //   "email": "john@email.com",

// you'll see -> TypeError: Cannot read property 'email' of undefined
// reason:
  /**
   * when we're sending data from the front-end and it's using JSON, 
   * so, we need to parse it because Express doesn't know what we just sent over; 
   * in order to be able to use 'req.body()' we need to use body-parser

// back to postman, and press send
  // you'll see 'success'
// if we change the password from 'cookies' to 'cookie'
  // you'll see 400 Bad Request with 'error logging in'
