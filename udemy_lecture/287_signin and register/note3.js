// you can't find Ann, why?
// reason:
/**
 * The reason that Ann wasn't added the first time around 
 * is because I changed the root route to include 'database.users', 
 * which meant the Nodemon had to restart; 
 * the server had to restart and start over.
 * 
 * And because these are JavaScript variables 
 * every time we restart the server this gets run all over again.
 * So the database initiates with just the two users.
 * Again we don't really use variables to store information that we need 
 * to what we call 'persist' â€“ that is to last and be memorized by the system. 
 * 
 * Databases are really really good because they run on disk 
 * somewhere out there in the world and they're really really 
 * good at keeping this information and not going down 
 * or if they do go down that they have backups 
 * so that users always get at it and we don't lose any information.
