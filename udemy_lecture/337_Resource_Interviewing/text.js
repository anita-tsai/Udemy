// Resource: Interviewing

/*

I actually recently released a course 
to help you through the interview process 
and land a dream job as a developer. 
You can see the course and the discount codes 
in the Extras section (very last one) titled: 
Part 2 - Special Gift For You

These are the best resources I have found on interviewing
and landing a job/career as a developer. 
I hope you find them useful:
