/** 293. Resource: CORS */
/*

CORS is an important concept in web security. 
Imagine a website superawesome.com has some data 
that the site flowershop.com wants to access. 
This type of request traditionally wouldn’t be allowed 
under the browser’s same origin policy (same URI scheme). 
However, by supporting CORS requests, 
superawesome.com can allow bob.com to access the data.
