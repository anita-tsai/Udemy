/*
And this is going to be, 'register' 
and this is going to be very similar to 'sign in'.
*/

// 1) create two folder and component named register 
// 1-1) copy singin.js and paste
// create a new div named 'name'
// delete a register div

// 2)
// And if we go back to the 'Signin', 
// we also don't really want this to be an anchor tag.
// We want to do a route change, 
// so we can just maybe do a 'p' tag
// and this 'p' tag will have the 'onClick' event as well.
// And on click, it will say that from 'signin' we want to go to 'register'.

// 3) import register component into App.js

// 4) modify the conditional statement to make us 
// if we click these bottons then we get the right page

// 5) modify the register form
