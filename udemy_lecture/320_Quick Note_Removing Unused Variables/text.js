/* Quick Note: Removing Unused Variables */
// In the next video we will have removed the old database variable 
// so make sure if you notice an error, 
// it's because you no longer have your "fake" database:

/*
app.get('/', (req, res) =>{
     res.send(database.users) // database variable no longer exists. 
     // You can replace the response here 
    //  with whatever you want such as res.send('success') 
    // since we won't really be using this route.
})
